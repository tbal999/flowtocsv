After building many iterations of this type of tool in the past, decided to build a brand new one with different logic in my free time.

This is an MRASCO ETL library that can convert MRASCO flows into CSV files.

This particular library can also handle other flat file types. My stance would be to try it out. If it works, great!

Through doing this I discovered new ways how to wrangle data using recursion in go. This library can be inserted into ETL packaged solutions.
