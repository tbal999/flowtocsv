After building many iterations of this type of tool in the past, decided to build a brand new one with different logic in my free time.

This is an MRASCO ETL library that can convert MRASCO flows into CSV files.
Through doing this I discovered new ways how to wrangle data using recursion in go. This can be inserted into ETL packaged solutions.
